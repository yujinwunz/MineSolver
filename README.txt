DESCRIPTION

A demo of Yujin Wu's unfortunate understanding of windows.

There are no solvers for windows 7 minesweeper and windows Vista minesweeper because no-one can be bothered to program a recognizer for glossy and eye-candy'd squares... until now.

Minesolver is an automatic minesweeper solver specifically for windows 7 and vista, but can be modded to solve any minesweeper game by replacing a few bitmaps. It can solve advanced just under 50% of the time, intermediate ~90% of the time, and beginners ~98% of the time.

It will also begin solving from any initial state; you can use it to dig you out of a difficult game.

FILES
Yes, main.cpp is the only source file. You may attempt to read the code, but I haven't written it for collaborative purposes.

/Pictures/ contains bitmaps used for image recognition. You may back them up and replace them (intuitively) with custom ones to allow the program to solve any version of minesweeper.


The working release can be found on the github's download section. The compiled executable has been tested under windows 7.

INSTALL

You will need Visual C++ (I used 2012) to compile this.
You need VC development libraries for SDL 1.2, get it from http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
